# App Flow Document

## Onboarding and Sign-In/Sign-Up
When a new user accesses the app, they are immediately presented with a sleek landing page that conveys the purpose of the demo prototype. There is no sign-in or account creation process because the prototype is designed for internal use only. The landing experience is simple with a clear call-to-action that invites the user to begin by entering customer details. In this demo, there is no need for traditional authentication or password recovery, ensuring that the user can start working with the tool without any additional steps. The focus is solely on demonstrating the integration of generative AI and telephony features in a clean and modern interface.

## Main Dashboard or Home Page
After landing on the app, the user is directed to the main page which features a single, modern, and clean interface built with NextJS 15. This page centers around a form where the user enters customer data. The form includes fields for the customer name, a dropdown for selecting a country code (with India pre-selected), an input for a 10-digit phone number, and an optional email address. Additionally, there are text areas for entering conversation history and topics to discuss. The design ensures that the user can easily navigate the page with an intuitive layout and clear input fields. The main page serves as the starting point for all further actions within the prototype.

## Detailed Feature Flows and Page Transitions
Once the user fills in the customer details on the main page, they click the submit button. This action sends the entered information to the backend where the data is stored using Supabase with a PostgreSQL database managed by Prisma ORM. Simultaneously, the system processes the submitted information using LangChainJS in conjunction with the OpenAI API to generate a calling sales script. The generated script is then displayed on a subsequent review screen where the user can see the complete sales script. The script is non-editable and is presented simply for confirmation before the call is initiated.

When the user is satisfied with the generated sales script, they proceed by clicking the 'Call the customer' button. This triggers the integration with Bland AI using API keys loaded securely from an .env file. At this point, Bland AI initiates the call based on the customer details and records the conversation. Upon completion of the call, Bland AI automatically processes the call to produce a transcript. The user interface is then automatically refreshed to display the call transcript and associated call details. In case the auto refresh does not occur due to any unforeseen delays, a manual refresh option is also provided to ensure that the final transcript can be viewed at all times.

Throughout the journey, users transition smoothly from the data input page to the sales script review page and finally to the call processing and transcript display page. This connected flow ensures that the user experiences a seamless journey from beginning to end without encountering any breaks in functionality.

## Settings and Account Management
Since this prototype is intended for demo use only, there are no traditional settings for user personalization or account management. The application does not involve user profiles, nor does it provide a section for configuring personal information or notification preferences. However, the app does include minimal configuration settings such as the country code default selection in the phone number input, which is set to India. After any interaction, including the completion of a call or viewing a transcript, the user can easily return to the main interface to continue working with the app. The simplicity of the design ensures that after viewing any call outcomes or error messages, the user is always just a click away from restarting the process or entering new customer information.

## Error States and Alternate Paths
The application is built with robust error handling to manage potential issues across the entire user journey. If the system fails to store the customer data, generate the sales script, or initiate the call through Bland AI, the user is provided with clear and meaningful error messages that describe the problem in simple language. In the event that the generated transcript does not appear due to connectivity issues or processing delays, the interface will show a prompt for the user to manually refresh the page. This manual refresh option is a fallback mechanism that ensures the user can always retrieve the latest call transcript if the automatic refresh fails. Each error or failure state is designed to guide the user back to a stable state, ensuring that the experience remains smooth and responsive despite any issues that may arise.

## Conclusion and Overall App Journey
From the moment a user lands on the app, the experience is designed to be as straightforward and uncluttered as possible. The user starts by entering customer details on a modern, clean single page. Once the data is submitted, it is stored securely and utilized to generate a calling sales script using advanced generative AI techniques. Without any intermediate steps for editing, the user directly reviews the generated script and then initiates a call through Bland AI. During the call, the system records and processes the conversation to automatically provide a transcript, all while offering fallback options to maintain a seamless experience. This end-to-end flow—from data entry to review, call initiation, and transcript delivery—demonstrates the complete potential of integrating modern technologies in a unified demo application. Every page, action, and error state has been carefully connected to provide a clear, robust, and user-friendly journey that meets the project’s objectives.
